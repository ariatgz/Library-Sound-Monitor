# STM32F4 Sound Monitoring Device

This repository contains the source code for a simple library sound monitoring device implemented using two STM32F4 microcontrollers. The project is designed to monitor and log sound levels in real time, providing a lightweight and efficient solution for noise analysis in a library environment.

## Features
- **Real-Time Sound Monitoring**: Captures and processes sound levels using STM32F4 microcontrollers.
- **Dual-Microcontroller Architecture**: One microcontroller handles sound data acquisition, while the other processes and displays the results.
- **Compact Design**: Optimized for low power and minimal hardware requirements.
- **Scalable**: Can be adapted for different environments and applications.
